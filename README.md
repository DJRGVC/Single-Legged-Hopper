## Project Overview

This project aims to create an untethered, single-legged, hopping robot. My work is inspired by Marc Raibert's development of a hydraulic-actuated, single-legged robot at the MIT Leg Laboratory in the 1980s. Since his initial foray into legged robotics, there have been a number of single-legged hopping robots created, from bulky, gyroscopically stabilized robots to feather-weight, self-balancing robots. As far as legged robots go, single-legged variations are the simplest in terms of  topology. Further, they can only perform one mode of locomotion: hopping. 

But why design a hopping robot? Although the dynamics of a hopping robot can be challenging, given their underlying simplicity, they are well suited to be a platform for the testing of various control algorithms. 

Furthermore, up until recent developments in the last 10 years, no hopping robot had been able to achieve true autonomy in 3D environment without the use of tethers, external battery supplies, or external sensors. This project aims to add to the short list of robots that have achieved this feat.


## Recent Updates

- [Update 1: Basic Circuit Design, Actuator Analysis, Literature Review](updates/reports/November8_2024.md)


## Workflow

1. **Literature Review**: Understand the current state of the field of legged robotics, with a focus on single-legged hopping robots.
2. **Initial Design**: Propose a design for a single-legged hopping robot rooted in designs identified during literature review.
3. **Preparation**: Analyze the proposed design for necessary components; then, order/fabricate parts
4. **Fail Fast**: Create a basic prototype to verify the feasibility of the design.
5. **Testing & Iteration**: Improve upon the initial design based on the results of testing the basic prototype.
